# Pizza Ecommerce

Basic Ecommerce built with React and React Router where you can add different kinds of pizza to a shopping cart, see the total amount, increase or decrease the quantity of the pizzas on the cart and delete it from it.

## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
  npm run dev
```

It is not responsive, so you'd better take a look at it on a desktop computer.
